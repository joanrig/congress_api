## Welcome to your Who's Who in the 116th Congress!

NOTE: this app has two Github repositories. This one is for the Rails API (back_end); the other repo is for the React-Redux front_end. (Link in instructions below.)

You can use this web app to search and sort all 542 members of the 116th United States Congress.

Just click on House or Senate, and then use the sort buttons or search field. It's fun to check out who missed the most votes!

Each member's card shows her full contact information, including social media accounts and a website link.

Future versions of this app will include information on who belongs to what committee, and which bills they are sponsoring. I would also like to add a quiz element. For instance, I can I can remove the senator's name from the front of the card and see if you can guess who's who!

I hope you can use this free app to learn more about Congress.
